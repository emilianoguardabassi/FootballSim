# Roadmap for FWCS (Football WorldusCup Simulatior)

## Objectives

1. Create a program that runs a simulation of the Football World cup.

2. It needs to be customizable, and easy to do so.

#### SideObjectives

- [ ] The team data can be updated from the official Fifa web.

- [ ] You can create custom teams via prompt (or possibly GUI) and add them to the roaster.

- [ ] You can inspect the team and get the data from the team and maybe players.

- [ ] Add customs events to the game, for example: "Messi dribbled three defenders and scored a goal".

- [ ] Export the data to an xlsx file.

- [ ] Implement a command that lets you input team data to create a custom team.

- [ ] Print stats of the corresponding ADT.


### How to accomplish the task

* Divide the files in various ADTs; maybe one for games, teams, players, crowd, etc.

* Join everything on a main file that executes the World cup event.  

* Load the teams with an input file (.in). (TBD)
